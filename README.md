# Zasta Coding Challenge

## Additional Information

The challenge was developed in a short period of time over a few days. I utilized the flexibility provided by the challenge and additionally implemented a rudimentary database connection, so the app is not solely a frontend challenge. Some design decisions may not be entirely practical in a real-world application, and itâ€™s clear that a more extensive feature set could be added in certain areas, which would have exceeded the scope of this challenge. I look forward to discussing my design decisions and the functionality of my small application with you.

## Used Technologies

- React (Vite) as frontend Framework
- Typescript as language
- tailwindcss for fast styling
- Google Cloud Firestore / Hosting for database and hosting
- lucide-react as icon collection
- classnames library for dynamic, state-based class names
